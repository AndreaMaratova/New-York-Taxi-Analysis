# New York Taxi Analysis

## Problem definition
Predict the average money spent on taxi rides for each region of New York given day and hour.

This problem is a supervides regression problem. Supervised because we have the actual value of the value we are trying to predict and regression because what we are trying to predict is a continuous variable (as opposed to catgorical).
